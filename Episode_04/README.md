Episode 4: Functions and Variable Environments (Summary)

ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts

Hoisting: Functions and variables are lifted to the top of their scope during memory allocation.

Local vs Global Scope: Variables declared inside a function (var x) are local and do not affect global variables with the same name.

Execution Contexts:

Global Execution Context (GEC): Created first, contains global variables and function definitions.

Local Execution Context (EC): Created when a function is called, contains local variables and parameters.

Call Stack: Keeps track of currently executing contexts. LIFO structure (Last In, First Out).

ðŸ“Œ Code Example

```js
var x = 1;

a();
b();

console.log(x); // 1

function a() {
    var x = 10;
    console.log(x); // 10
}

function b() {
    var x = 100;
    console.log(x); // 100
}
```

ðŸ“Œ Output
10
100
1

ðŸ“Œ Summary of Execution

GEC is created; x = undefined, a and b functions hoisted.

Global x assigned 1.

a() â†’ local x = 10 â†’ prints 10 â†’ EC removed.

b() â†’ local x = 100 â†’ prints 100 â†’ EC removed.

Global console.log(x) prints 1.

ðŸ“Œ Quick Review Questions

Output of code? â†’ 10, 100, 1

Why can we call functions before declaration? â†’ Hoisting

Are local variables the same as global ones? â†’ No, they are separate

Role of Call Stack? â†’ Track execution contexts

What happens after function execution? â†’ Local EC removed from Call Stack
